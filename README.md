# **Project Name**:  

PacMen

# **Description**: 

The PacMen project has two buttons: one for creating more PacMen and another to make the PacMen move.

This project is an example of my Javascript, HTML5, and css coding capabilities, and as such, it is one component of my professional portfolio. This particular project is based off of a similar activity I worked on in May of 2023 involving Pacmen from the MIT xPro via Emeritus bootcamp I was enrolled in called "Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN."

# **Installation**: 

The following files are needed to duplicate this project: PacMen.html, PacMen.js, PacMen.css. Additionally, 4 Pacmen icons are used for creating new PacMen.

# **How to Run**:

To run my project on your machine, load the website onto a web browser. 

Internet connection required. Both Chrome and Edge browsers will work.

# **Support**: 

Please contact me via email at krentmeester@uwalumni.com.

# **Roadmap**: 

Future fixes or improvements that would be helpful to a user:

*Changing the size, shape, and color of the PacMen.

*Having the PacMen disappear once they hit the edge or once they collide with another PacMan.
